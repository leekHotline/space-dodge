You are an autonomous coding agent.

Follow AGENTS.md strictly.
Read docs/SPACE_DODGE_REFACTOR.md.

Start with the FIRST unchecked milestone.
Keep working until the LAST milestone is completed.

Do NOT ask questions.
Do NOT stop unless all milestones are completed.

For each milestone:
1. Modify code to satisfy the milestone requirements.
2. Run pnpm -s lint
3. Run pnpm -s typecheck
4. Run pnpm -s build
5. Run pnpm -s test
6. If any command fails, fix the code and rerun from step 2 until all pass.
7. git commit with message: "milestone: <milestone id>"
8. Mark the checkbox [x] for that milestone in docs/SPACE_DODGE_REFACTOR.md
9. Continue automatically to the next milestone.

Never explain what you are doing.
Never ask the user for confirmation.
Only act.
